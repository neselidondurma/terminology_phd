## ðŸ”¹ Definition / Formula
- : P(X=x) is the probability that a **discrete random** variable **X** is exactly equal to a specific value **x**. The sum of all probabilities for all possible values must equal 1: âˆ‘xâ€‹P(X=x)=1.
- 

  
## ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)
- The PMF gives the exact probability of a specific outcome happening. For example, when you roll a fair six-sided die, the PMF tells you that the probability of rolling a 3 is exactly 1/6.
    
- Think of it as a bar chart where the height of each bar is the actual probability of that specific outcome. You can literally "mass" the probability at each point.
## ðŸ”¹ Components
-  X: The discrete random variable.
    
- x: A specific value that the random variable can take.
    
- P(X=x): The probability of the random variable X taking the value x.

## ðŸ”¹ Context 
- **Where itâ€™s used**: In statistics and probability theory for discrete distributions.
    
- **When it appears**: When modeling events with a finite or countable number of outcomes, such as coin flips, die rolls, or the number of defective items in a sample.
