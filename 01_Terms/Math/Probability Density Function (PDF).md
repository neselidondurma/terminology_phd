## ðŸ”¹ Definition / Formula
- : For **continous variables**: 
- P(aâ‰¤Xâ‰¤b)=âˆ«abâ€‹f(x)dx, where f(x) is the PDF. The probability is the **area under the curve** of the function f(x) between two points, a and b. The total area under the entire curve must equal 1: âˆ«âˆ’âˆžâˆžâ€‹f(x)dx=1.

  
## ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)
- The PDF describes the relative likelihood of a continuous variable falling within a certain range. Unlike a PMF, the value of the PDF at a single point, f(x), is not a probability itself. The probability of any single, exact value is zero.
    
- Imagine a smooth, continuous hill. The height of the hill at any point is the "density" of probability, but to find an actual probability, you have to measure the area under a section of the hill. The taller the hill is, the more likely the value is to be in that area.
    

## ðŸ”¹ Components

- X: The continuous random variable.
    
- f(x): The probability density function.
    
- âˆ«: The integral symbol, used to find the area under the curve.
    

## ðŸ”¹ Context

- **Where itâ€™s used**: In statistics and probability theory for continuous distributions.
    
- **When it appears**: When modeling phenomena that can be measured on a continuous scale, such as height, weight, temperature, or time.
