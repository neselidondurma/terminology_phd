## ðŸ”¹ Definition / Formula
- Paralinguistic features are the non-verbal elements of communication that modify or enrich the meaning of spoken language. 
- They are the "how" of what's said, as opposed to the "what."

  
## ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)
- In simple terms, paralinguistics is about the sounds and vocal cues that accompany words. They include things like a person's tone of voice, pitch, and speed of speech.
    
- Think of a parent saying to a child, "You're a genius." If they say it with a playful, high-pitched tone, it's a compliment. If they say it slowly with a flat, sarcastic tone, it means the opposite. The words are the same, but the paralinguistic features change the entire meaning.

## ðŸ”¹ Components
- **Vocal Quality**: The characteristics of a voice, such as its texture (e.g., breathy, raspy).
    
- **Pitch**: The highness or lowness of the voice.
    
- **Volume**: The loudness or softness of the voice.
    
- **Speech Rate**: How fast or slow a person speaks.
    
- **Vocalizations**: Non-word sounds like sighs, laughs, or throat clearing.
    
- **Pauses and Silence**: The strategic use of silence.

## ðŸ”¹ Context 
- This term is a core concept in **linguistics** and **communication studies**.
    
- It is also relevant in **psychology** (e.g., non-verbal cues in social interactions), **anthropology** (cross-cultural communication), and **machine learning** (speech recognition and sentiment analysis models that analyze tone).

## ðŸ”¹ Related
- **Non-verbal communication**: A broader term that includes paralinguistic features as well as body language, gestures, and facial expressions.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples / Applications
- **Public Speaking**: An effective speaker uses changes in pitch, volume, and pace to keep the audience engaged and emphasize key points.
