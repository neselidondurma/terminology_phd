### Definition / Formula

- **Model CI/CD** extends the standard Continuous Integration ($\text{CI}$) and Continuous Delivery ($\text{CD}$) software practices to include the unique artifacts of machine learning: **code, data, and models**.
    
- It is a pipeline that automates the process from model development and training to testing, versioning, and deployment into a production environment.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)

- Model CI/CD is the **automation blueprint** for reliably getting a machine learning model from a data scientist's notebook into a live application. It aims to make model updates, retraining, and deployment frequent, low-risk, and predictable.
    
- Unlike traditional software CI/CD, the pipeline must also validate the **data** and the **trained model's performance** (not just the code's functionality). This is like an **automated factory for AI**; every time a component (code, data, or model parameters) changes, the factory automatically runs quality checks and prepares a new, tested product for release.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Components

- **CI ($\text{Continuous Integration}$):** Automated testing of **code, data, and model** logic, including unit tests, data validation, and training verification.
    
- **CT ($\text{Continuous Training}$):** Automated retraining and validation of the model using new data or code, often triggered by data drift.
    
- **CD ($\text{Continuous Delivery/Deployment}$):** Automated packaging of the ML model artifact (including the model file, serving code, and dependencies) and its deployment to a staging or production environment.
    
- **Model Registry ($\mathbf{R}$):** A centralized system for tracking, versioning, and managing trained models and their metadata.
    
- **ML Artifacts ($\mathbf{A}$):** The output of the CI/CT pipeline, which includes the serialized model file, its dependencies, and container configuration (like a Dockerfile).
    

### ðŸ”¹ Context

- **Where itâ€™s used:** **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)**, data science teams looking to productionize models, and any organization needing frequent, reliable updates to their AI-powered services.
    
- **When it appears:** It's essential when a model needs to be **retrained often** (e.g., due to **data drift**), when the underlying **model code changes**, or when deploying an ML service requires high availability and minimal downtime.

### ðŸ”¹ Examples / Applications

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** A change in the fraudulent transaction patterns (data drift) triggers the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automatically:
    
    1. **CI/CT:** Pulls new data, retrains the model, and runs a validation step to ensure the new model's F1-score is above a threshold of 0.9.
        
    2. **CD:** If the score passes, the model is registered in the Model Registry, containerized, and deployed to a **Canary** environment (a small subset of production traffic) for live testing.
        
    3. If the canary phase passes, the pipeline automatically promotes the new model to **full production**.
