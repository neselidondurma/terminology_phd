## ðŸ”¹ Definition / Formula
- : P(Wâˆ£O) is the probability of a word sequence
	- **W** given an acoustic observation sequence
	- **O**. This is often modeled using the
		- **Bayes' theorem**: P(Wâˆ£O)=P(O)P(Oâˆ£W)P(W)â€‹, 
			- where P(Oâˆ£W) is the **acoustic model**, 
			- P(W) is the **language model**, 
			- P(O) is the evidence.

  
## ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)
-  Automatic Speech Recognition is a technology that converts spoken words into text. It's essentially the process of a computer listening to a person speak and transcribing what they said.
    
- Think of it as a super-smart translator for sound. Instead of translating one language to another, it translates the sounds of human speech into written words

## ðŸ”¹ Components
- **Acoustic Model**: Maps sound (phonemes, acoustic features) to speech units (e.g., words).
    
- **Language Model**: Predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words appearing together in a specific language. This helps resolve ambiguities, like distinguishing "recognize speech" from "wreck a nice beach."
    
- **Pronunciation Dictionary**: A lexicon that maps words to their phonetic pronunciations.
    
- **Decoder**: Combines the acoustic and language models to find the most probable sequence of words for a given audio input.

## ðŸ”¹ Context 
-  **Where itâ€™s used**: Primarily in **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)**. It's a foundational technology for voice-controlled devices and applications.
    
- **When it appears**: It's a core component of many modern systems, especially those involving human-computer interaction via voice, like virtual assistants and transcription services.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples / Applications
-  **Virtual Assistants**: When you say "Hey Siri" or "Hey Google," ASR is what converts your voice command into text that the device can process.
    
- **Transcription Services**: Services like Otter.ai or YouTube's automatic captions use ASR to convert audio and video content into written transcripts.
    
- **Hands-Free Operation**: It enables navigation systems in cars or smart home devices to be controlled by voice, improving safety and convenience.
