## ðŸ”¹ Definition / Formula

- : Frequency_vocal_folds=Pitch_perceivedâ€‹
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)

- **Frequency** is the **physical rate** of vocal fold vibration, while **pitch** is the **subjective perception** of that sound frequency by the listener.
    
- Although they usually align, they can differ significantly, for instance, when the **vocal tract** emphasizes a higher harmonic of the fundamental frequency, causing the listener to perceive the **harmonic's frequency** as the main pitch.
    
- **Analogy:** Think of pitch as the **perceived color** and frequency as the **actual wavelength** of light; usually they match, but in specific lighting conditions (like vocal tract resonances), your brain might interpret a blended color as a different primary color.

## ðŸ”¹ Components

- **Vocal Fold Frequency** (or Fundamental Frequency): The actual physical rate of vibration of the vocal folds (measured in Hertz, Hz).
    
- **Pitch**: The perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale.
    
- **Harmonics**: Integer multiples of the fundamental frequency produced by the vibrating vocal folds.
    
- **Vocal Tract Resonances**: The filtering effect of the mouth, throat, and nasal cavities which can selectively amplify specific frequencies (harmonics).

## ðŸ”¹ Context

- **Where it's used:** **Acoustic Phonetics**, **Speech Science**, **Psychoacoustics** (the study of the psychological response to sound).
    
- **When it appears:** This phenomenon is fundamental to understanding how **vowels** are perceived, how **singers** manipulate their voice, and how human pitch perception operates, which often includes **missing fundamental** effects.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples / Applications

**Case Study: Overtones and Perceived Pitch**

1. A speaker's **vocal folds** vibrate at a fundamental frequency (F0â€‹) of 100Â Hz.
    
2. The resulting sound contains a **harmonic series** (e.g., 100Â Hz, 200Â Hz, 300Â Hz, 400Â Hz, etc.).
    
3. **Vocal Tract Resonances** strongly amplify the third harmonic at 300Â Hz, making it much louder than the 100Â Hz fundamental.
    
4. The listener's auditory system (due to a phenomenon called **periodicity detection**) may ignore the quieter 100Â Hz and perceive the **pitch** as 300Â Hz (the frequency of the louder harmonic) instead of the actual physical F0â€‹. The perceived pitch is then the frequency of the harmonic instead of the fundamental.
