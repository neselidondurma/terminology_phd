## 🔹## Definition / Formula

- : **Phonetics** is the scientific study of **speech sounds**—their production (articulation), their physical properties (acoustics), and their perception (audition). It focuses on the physical reality of sounds, known as **phones**.
    

$$\text{Phonetics} = \text{Articulatory} + \text{Acoustic} + \text{Auditory}$$

(Conceptual formula: The three main branches of phonetics)

## 🔹 Explanation (in my words)

- **Phonetics** is the discipline that analyzes **how we make, hear, and measure the physical sounds** that constitute human speech, regardless of language. It deals with the raw, tangible elements of spoken language.
    
- Think of it as the **"laboratory science"** of speech. It uses tools like spectrograms (to see sound waves) and anatomical models (to study the vocal tract) to precisely classify and describe every sound a human can make, such as the position of the tongue, the vibration of the vocal cords, and the sound wave's frequency.

## 🔹 Components

- **Phone:** The fundamental unit of study in phonetics; a concrete, physical speech sound (represented in brackets, e.g., $[p]$).
    
- **Articulatory Phonetics:** How speech sounds are **produced** using the vocal apparatus (lips, tongue, vocal folds). Variables include **Place of Articulation** (e.g., bilabial, alveolar) and **Manner of Articulation** (e.g., stop, fricative).
    
- **Acoustic Phonetics:** The **physical transmission** of speech sounds as sound waves. Variables include **Frequency ($\text{F}$)**, **Amplitude ($\text{A}$) (loudness)**, and **Duration**.
    
- **Auditory Phonetics:** How the human ear and brain **perceive** speech sounds.

## 🔹 Context

- **Where it's used:** Core to **Linguistics**, **Speech-Language Pathology**, **Forensic Science** (speaker identification), and **Speech Technology**.
    
- **When it appears:** It forms the **initial layer** of language processing in both humans and machines (like **Automatic Speech Recognition, ASR**). ASR systems must perform phonetic analysis to convert the acoustic signal (a raw sound wave) into a sequence of recognizable phones or phonemes.

## 🔹 Examples / Applications

**Small Worked-Out Example: Describing the Phone $[p]$**

The phone $[p]$ (the sound at the start of 'pin') is described phonetically using three main articulatory features:

1. **Voicing:** **Voiceless** (vocal cords do not vibrate).
    
2. **Place of Articulation:** **Bilabial** (produced using both lips).
    
3. **Manner of Articulation:** **Stop** (airflow is completely stopped and then released).
    

This detailed, universal description allows a speech technologist or linguist to exactly reproduce or analyze the sound, distinguishing it from related sounds like the voiced bilabial stop $[b]$ (as in 'bin').
