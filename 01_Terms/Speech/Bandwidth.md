## ðŸ”¹ Definition / Formula
- : The range of frequencies a signal contains. For a baseband signal like speech, this is the highest frequency component.

  
## ðŸ”¹ Explanation (in my words)
Bandwidth refers to the "width" of the frequency spectrum used by a signal. Think of it like a highway with a limited number of lanes: a wider highway (more bandwidth) can carry more information and detail. For speech, a wider bandwidth captures more high-frequency sounds, making the voice sound clearer, more natural, and more detailed. A narrow bandwidth, on the other hand, makes speech sound dull or "muffled" because many of the high-frequency components are cut off.

## ðŸ”¹ Components
- **BW**: Bandwidth (in Hz).
    
- **fmaxâ€‹**: The highest frequency component of the signal.

## ðŸ”¹ Context 
- Bandwidth is a key characteristic used in **telecommunications**, **audio compression**, and **speech quality assessment**.
    
- The bandwidth of a speech signal directly relates to its perceived quality and determines the required **sampling rate** to avoid aliasing.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples / Applications
- **Narrowband (NB)**: Used in traditional telephony. The bandwidth is limited to about 300-3400 Hz. This bandwidth is sufficient for speech intelligibility but lacks the naturalness of a face-to-face conversation.
    
- **Wideband (WB)**: Used in technologies like "HD Voice" and VoIP. The bandwidth is typically 50-7000 Hz. This wider range captures more of the human voice's natural harmonics, leading to much clearer, higher-quality calls.
    
- **Fullband (FB)**: Used for high-fidelity audio and music, with a bandwidth up to 20,000 Hz. This is used for applications like high-quality voice recording and music streaming, providing a full, rich sound.
