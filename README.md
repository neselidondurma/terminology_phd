# Terminology & Formula Notes in ML + Neuroscience

Welcome 👋 This repository is my **open PhD glossary** — a living collection of terms, formulas, and short explanations I encounter as I work at the intersection of **machine learning, neuroscience, and healthcare**.  

I believe that science should be **transparent, accessible, and reproducible**. By sharing these notes publicly, I aim to:
- Make complex terminology in ML and neuroscience more approachable  
- Build a resource for students and researchers entering the field  
- Document my own learning journey as a PhD student

## 🧑‍🔬 About me
I’m a **first-year Ph.D. student** at the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), [Hertie Institute for AI in Brain Health](https://www.hih-tuebingen.de/en/research/research-groups/research-groups/hertie-institute-for-ai-in-brain-health/), and [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/).  

My research focuses on:
- **Digital biomarkers** for the **early detection of neuropsychological diseases**  
- Combining **machine learning** and **neuroscience** for healthcare  
- Exploring how we can **democratize healthcare** through AI and accessible tools
